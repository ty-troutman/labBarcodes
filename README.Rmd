This repository houses information and analyses of Troutman lab sequencing barcodes. Full length unique dual index adapters, set 4 (289:384) were purchased from Perkin Elmer. We also have small aliquots of set 1 and 2 shared from the labs' of Chris Glass and Sven Heinz at UC San Diego. Nextera barcoding PCR primers were ordered from IDT and sourced from a Howard Chang and William Greenleaf publication in Nature. The data is in **[Supplementary Table 1](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnature14590/MediaObjects/41586_2015_BFnature14590_MOESM36_ESM.xlsx)**.
